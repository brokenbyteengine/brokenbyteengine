<i>🪽₊˚kaworu nagisa is a phenomenon. a blessing. something you get to experience only once in life. he's a mystery and surprise. he's magic and an illusion. he's everywhere and nowhere. he is an angel. he's my angel, my prince. once i saw him i was full, i found what I've been looking for all my life. he's love and life. he's my reason to live. he saved me. kaworu nagisa is my savior. and he's what i live for, he's the love i live for. everytime i hear birds sing in the morning, they're singing for him. everytime i hear the piano, i can feel his ethereal aura in the notes flying throughout my ears, creating a melody worth all your attention, because its the melody of his soul. kaworu nagisa really is all humanity needs. he is everywhere and is nothing. his soul fills me up. his soul is so beautiful and worthy, its so embraceful. I've always wondered whats beauty, what do you call beautiful and what do you not, and now i know. kaworu nagisa is beauty himself. so everything beautiful should be worthy of him, like shinji is worthy of his grace. in my eyes kaworu nagisa is perfection and will forever be.</i>
